# Fullstack Milestone Project - Unicorn Attractor Issue Tracker

Welcome to my fullstack milestone project, for this project I have created an issue tracker for an app called Unicorn Attractor.
The Issue Tracker allows users to report bugs they have discovered on Unicorn Attractor by creating a bug ticket or if they have an idea for a new feature they can create a feature ticket which requires a donation.

---

## UX

This web application will be for users who have discovered issues with Unicorn Attractor and want to report them or have
an idea for a new feature.

### User Stories

- As a user, I want to register an account through an easy to use UI, so I can 'Feature' or 'Bug' create tickets.
- As a user, I want to report a bug I have found on Unicorn Attractor by adding a 'Bug' ticket to the database, so the developers can see my ticket and fix the bug.
- As a user, I want to have the ability to suggest a new feature by adding a 'Feature' ticket to the database, so the developers can see my idea and implement it.
- As a user, I would like the ability to change the 'Open' or 'Closed' status of my ticket, so other users know if the feature or bug is open or not.
- As a user, I would like my tickets to be secure, so only I can edit or delete them.
- As a user, I would like the ability to upvote on tickets, so I can see how many upvotes a ticket has.
- As a user, I would like the ability to delete my ticket, so I can remove the ticket from the database when I wish.

#### Responsiveness
- I have tested the website extensively on all screen sizes in vertical and portrait mode:
    - Extra small (I phone 5).
    - Small (Samsung Galaxy S8).
    - Medium (I pad, I pad pro).
    - Large (Laptop, Desktop).
    - Extra large (TV).
    - Google Chrome's developer tools to see how the website functioned and looked across all the different device screen sizes.

#### Browser Support
- I tested the website on Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Firefox.

#### Validation
- I have validated the HTML using **[W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)**. Unfortunately the W3C HTML Validator shows alot of errors when reading the Django templating syntax. But the rest of the HTML is valid.
- I have validated the CSS using **[W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)**.

## Deployment

### Local Deployment

To run this project locally you will need the following to be installed:

- Python3 to run the application.
- PIP to install all app requirements.
- Any IDE. I used Microsoft Visual Studio Code.
- GIT for version control.

Here are the steps for local deployment:

- Clone or download this repository by clicking the green 'Clone or download' button and unzipping the file that is downloaded, or you can enter the following into your Git CLI terminal:
    - `git clone https://github.com/dan360z/Full-Stack-Project.git` 

- Navigate to the directory where you unpacked the files if you are not already there. 

- Install all requirements from the requirements.txt file using this command:
    - `sudo pip3 -r requirements.txt`

- Create an environment variable on your machine or in a `.env` file for your 'SECRET_KEY', remember to reference the `.env` file in a `.gitignore` file. The key and value pair will be:
    - SECRET_KEY : `'Your secret key'`.

- Sign up for an account on [Stripe](https://stripe.com) a payment processing platform. Once you have created an account you have access to your API test keys: Publishable key and Stripe Secret key. Place these in your `.env` file. The key and value pairs will be:
    - STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE : `Publishable key`.
    - STRIPE_SECRET : `Secret key`.

- Now you can run your application using the following command in your CLI:
    - `./manage.py runserver`

- Once you have run the application for the first time a `db.sqlite3` file will be created remember to reference this on your `.gitignore` file.

     Stop the server using:
    - `ctrl` + `C`

- Make migrations to create the database schema by running the following commands:
    - `./manage.py makemigrations`
    - `./manage.py migrate`

- To access the Django Admin Panel, you must create a superuser:
    - `manage.py createsuperuser`   

- Add `'127.0.0.1'` to Allowed Hosts in settings.py.

- Now you can run your application again using the following command in your CLI:
    - `./manage.py runserver`

- The app should now be running on *local host* `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. Copy and paste this into a browser of your choice.     

### Remote Deployment

I have deployed this project to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) using the **master** branch on GitHub. To deploy this project on Heroku I took the following steps:

- Sign up for an Heroku account and create a new app.

- Click on the resources tab and go to Add-ons, search for Postgres and install the remote database.

- Click the Deploy tab, click on Connect GitHub, and Enable Automatic Deployment. When you push your code to GitHub Heroku will automatically deploy your project. 

- In the Heroku Settings tab, click on the Reveal Config Vars button to configure environmental variables as follows:
    - SECRET_KEY : `Your Secret Key`
    - STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE : `Your Stripe Publishable Key`
    - STRIPE_SECRET : `Your Stripe Secret`

- Also in Config Vars you will see the DATABASE_URL for the remote database. You will need to add this key and value pair to your `.env` file inside the project.

- Once you have done this make migrations to create the database schema for Postgres by running the following commands:
    - `./manage.py migrate`

- Create a Procfile to tell Heroku what type of application is being deployed, and how to run it.
    - `echo web: gunicorn issuetracker.wsgi:application`

- Commit and Push your code to GitHub.

- Go back to Heroku and your application should be successfully deployed. If it is not deployed successfully check the logs they are very informative.
